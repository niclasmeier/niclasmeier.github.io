<p>After been almost 10 years at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sinnerschrader.de&#47;">SinnerSchrader<&#47;a> it's very confusing for me to be on the move again. On the 1<sup>st<&#47;sup> of December I joined <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.playmakerstudio.com&#47;">Playmaker Studio<&#47;a> after being at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gamigo.de">gamigo<&#47;a> for 18 month.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-107"></a>You now may ask why? I don't want to explain every thought that led to the decision, but I can say I enjoyed my job at gamigo. I learned damn much, especially stuff I never anticipated (I am not saying that I didn't wanted to learn most of it ;-)). I had a great team making a giant leap in the software development processes, nice colleagues and we brought the company a huge step ahead.</p>
<p>But it was more than about time to get a new direction in working life. At gamigo my job drifted to a pure management position and I was  nudging around <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.atlassian.com&#47;de&#47;software&#47;jira&#47;overview">JIRA tickets<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;office.microsoft.com&#47;de-de&#47;excel&#47;">Excel files<&#47;a> (okay some of them where <a href="https:&#47;&#47;docs.google.com&#47;">Google Docs<&#47;a> ;-)) the whole day. But now I joined the Ranks of technicians again <code><cheer &#47;><&#47;code>!</p>
<p>Hopefully I will have some time for reviving this blog. For now I am trying to learn some new stuff - like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;clojure.org&#47;">Clo<i>j<&#47;i>ure<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;webnoir.org&#47;">Noir<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.heroku.com&#47;">Heroku<&#47;a> or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mongodb.org&#47;">mongoDB<&#47;a>for my new job. For me, this sounds like lots of fun!</p>
