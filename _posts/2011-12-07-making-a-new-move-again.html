  it's very confusing for me to be on the move again. On the 1<sup>st</sup> of
  December I joined <a href="http://www.playmakerstudio.com/">Playmaker
  Studio</a> after being at <a href="http://www.gamigo.de">gamigo</a>
  for 18 month.

<p>After been almost 10 years at <a href="http://www.sinnerschrader.de/">SinnerSchrader</a> it's very confusing for me to be on the move again. On the 1<sup>st</sup> of December I joined <a href="http://www.playmakerstudio.com/">Playmaker Studio</a> after being at <a href="http://www.gamigo.de">gamigo</a> for 18 month.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-107"></a>You now may ask why? I don't want to explain every thought that led to the decision, but I can say I enjoyed my job at gamigo. I learned damn much, especially stuff I never anticipated (I am not saying that I didn't wanted to learn most of it ;-)). I had a great team making a giant leap in the software development processes, nice colleagues and we brought the company a huge step ahead.</p>
<p>But it was more than about time to get a new direction in working life. At gamigo my job drifted to a pure management position and I was  nudging around <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/de/software/jira/overview">JIRA tickets</a> and <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/de-de/excel/">Excel files</a> (okay some of them where <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> ;-)) the whole day. But now I joined the Ranks of technicians again <code><cheer /></code>!</p>
<p>Hopefully I will have some time for reviving this blog. For now I am trying to learn some new stuff - like <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clo<i>j</i>ure</a>, <a href="http://webnoir.org/">Noir</a>, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">mongoDB</a>for my new job. For me, this sounds like lots of fun!</p>
