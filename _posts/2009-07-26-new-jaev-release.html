<p>Today I made a new release of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jaev.googlecode.com">jaev Framework<&#47;a> for "advanced" e-mail validation. After being in productive use for quite some month now it was about time to offer a bugfix release. Some issues with domains containing no MX but an A DNS record where resolved. E-mail belonging to this kind of domains will now be accepted. An issue with a file handle leak due to unclosed UDP connections during the DNS lookup was also fixed.</p>
<p>Due to the generosity of Google I got a nice <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wave.google.com&#47;">Google wave<&#47;a> test account. Now I am looking desperately to some spare time to evaluate the integration of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jaev.googlecode.com">jaev<&#47;a> to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wave.google.com&#47;">wave<&#47;a>. One idea is to expand the validation to wave addresses via the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.waveprotocol.org&#47;">wave protocol<&#47;a>. Maybe an online validation as wave bot is another exciting idea.</p>
