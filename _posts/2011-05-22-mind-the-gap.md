It's sunday and I am fed up, sitting lazy behind my computer and taking a review of the last week. I attended two conferences this week so I am full of new ideas (don't know if they are good yet) and wan't to take a closer look on so many topics.

The first conference was the [next conference](http://nextconf.eu) in Berlin which was initiated some years a go by my former employer [SinnerSchrader](http://www.sinnerschrader.de). So the focus of the [next conference](http://nextconf.eu) was mixture of brand, media, entrepreneurship and technology. Due to the fact that I meet a couple of former colleagues - some of them still working for [SinnerSchrader](http://www.sinnerschrader.de).

The second conference was the [Developer Conference Hamburg 2011](http://www.devcon-hamburg.de/) which had a sole technology focus. I heard couple of very good talks on both conferences. My highlight was the the keynote of [Werner Vogels](http://www.cardcloud.com/werner) the CTO of Amazon which spoke about the analysis of big dataset which are regularly produced by modern IT infrastructures. If you generate a couple of gigabytes of data every day you should get the information out of them.

Another highlight of both conferences where the [Couch DB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) talks. Both held by [Jan Lehnhardt](http://twitter.com/#!/janl), one of the [Couch DB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) core commiters who works for [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/). Jan can talk very fast in his talks, especially when he had some coffee :-). But there is no bull*** and he definitely knows what he is talking about. Because I attended the [next](http://nextconf.eu) and the [devcon](http://www.devcon-hamburg.de/) I was able to get a 10.000m overview and a 100m close look on the [Couch DB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). I am very fascinated by this topic, but I have at the moment no idea where to use it.

A dilemma what [Couch DB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) shares with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). I heard of [node](http://nodejs.org/) on both conference too. On the next [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) was presented by [Isaac Z. Schlueter](http://blog.izs.me/). The topic was how [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) performs on DIRT (<u>d</u>ata <u>i</u>ntensive <u>r</u>eal <u>t</u>ime) applications. At [devcon](http://www.devcon-hamburg.de/) [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) was presented by [Felix Geisendörfer](http://twitter.com/#!/felixge) which gave a more wide range overview on the capabilites of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Unfortunately my [current employer](http://www.gamigo.de) does at the moment some kind of "boring" ;-) e-commerce stuff, so no real use for node here. Some [SinnerSchrader](http://www.sinnerschrader.de) guys had a very innovative idea using node building the [The World’s First Digital Foosball Table](http://digitalfoosball.com/) - nice one!

But the most influencing talks where from [Prof. Dr. Friedrich Esser](http://www.informatik.haw-hamburg.de/esser.html) from the [HAW Hamburg](http://www.haw-hamburg.de/) about [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). The talk and the workshops where full of snappy remarks on [Java](http://www.java.com/) programming language. I am doing Java for over ten years now. And I am confident that I am pretty good at [Java](http://www.java.com/) and it was my favorite language the last ten years. But in the recent time I am feeling bored by [Java](http://www.java.com/) and it's very tight restrictions. We'll see where the journey goes with this [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) stuff.

On the other hand side there were also some talks - which we presented brilliantly - that where about stuff that I am doing for a couple of year now. One of these was the "Abstract monitoring" talk from [Dr. Johannes Mainusch](https://www.xing.com/profile/Johannes_Mainusch) from Xing. Very nice talk, I agree 100% but I was also doing this since 2005\. Good to see that other developers are cooking with water too ;-)

But the last week reminded me of the gap what we have at the moment and what I am supposed to close as soon as possible. But now I am armed with some new ideas ...
