  Friday evening I read about the new version of JSF. The reference implementation (RI) Mojarra made an early draft review (EDR) of Mojarra 2.0 which implements the lastest specification of the JSR-314 which features JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.0.

<p>I don't want so summarize alle the new little gizmos in the JSF 2.0 spec or the EDR, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.sun.com&#47;rlubke&#47;">Ryan Lubke<&#47;a> does this in his<a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.sun.com&#47;rlubke&#47;"> blog<&#47;a> already. There will be a long way to go to finish all the issues of the JSR but I can't stand to comment the one or other thing.</p>
<p>Like i.e. the project stage feature. Damn I am doing this like this for years in my application. It's a wonderful way to tell the application how many secrets have to be kept in this environment.<br />
In a test environment I like the application to be very verbose and tell my of every little affliction, but in productive envorinments the application has to be very reticent. I don't want to tell the bad guys out there all over the internet about the flaws in the application.<br />
One thing I am still missing, which goes hand in hand with project stages in my appliations it the version number. The application provides facilities to access the version number of the application and display it in any page. A wonderful tools to communicate with our QA department. They can check the version history if an issues was solved in the current version deployed on the test and QA system and they don't have to recheck about the version with me every time.</p>
<p>Another nice feature I noticed is, that in JSF 2.0 the component tree may be aware of the head and body areas in a HTML page. So it now should be quite easy to add CSS and Java-Scipts to a page. This may end some nasty implementations to re-parse the rendered output before it's send to the client to add CSS or Java-Scripts to the header. Or worse the tons of inline Java-Script code.<br />
Let's be honest most of the HTML code generated by JSF is quite a horror and the frontend engineers are hating it a long time. Maybe we'll get some really nice HTML code now, so we don't need any more perfomace hacks to accellerate the bad HTML code.</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on the JSF 2.0 spec, it may solve much of the pain I have to today using JSF ...</p>
