After been almost 10 years at [SinnerSchrader](http://www.sinnerschrader.de/) it's very confusing for me to be on the move again. On the 1<sup>st</sup> of December I joined [Playmaker Studio](http://www.playmakerstudio.com/) after being at [gamigo](http://www.gamigo.de) for 18 month. You now may ask why? I don't want to explain every thought that led to the decision, but I can say I enjoyed my job at gamigo. I learned damn much, especially stuff I never anticipated (I am not saying that I didn't wanted to learn most of it ;-)). I had a great team making a giant leap in the software development processes, nice colleagues and we brought the company a huge step ahead.

But it was more than about time to get a new direction in working life. At gamigo my job drifted to a pure management position and I was nudging around [JIRA tickets](http://www.atlassian.com/de/software/jira/overview) and [Excel files](http://office.microsoft.com/de-de/excel/) (okay some of them where [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) ;-)) the whole day. But now I joined the Ranks of technicians again !

Hopefully I will have some time for reviving this blog. For now I am trying to learn some new stuff - like [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), [Noir](http://webnoir.org/), [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) or [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for my new job. For me, this sounds like lots of fun!
