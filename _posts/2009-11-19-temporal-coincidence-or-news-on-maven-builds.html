  A few weeks ago I wrote a <a href="&#47;2009&#47;11&#47;some-thoughts-about-building&#47;">blog entry<&#47;a> about building applications with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;maven.apache.org">Apache Maven<&#47;a> and where I see the most demanding problems with Maven builds.

  Coincidentally <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;jvanzyl">Jason van Zyl<&#47;a> a mastermind behind the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;maven.apache.org">Apache Maven<&#47;a> Project wrote a series of articles on the  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sonatype.com&#47;people&#47;author&#47;jason&#47;">blog<&#47;a> at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sonatype.com">Sonartype<&#47;a>, which are describing the future road map of Maven 3.0.

<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a <a href="&#47;2009&#47;11&#47;some-thoughts-about-building&#47;">blog entry<&#47;a> about building applications with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;maven.apache.org">Apache Maven<&#47;a> and where I see the most demanding problems with Maven builds.</p>
<p>Coincidentally <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;jvanzyl">Jason van Zyl<&#47;a> a mastermind behind the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;maven.apache.org">Apache Maven<&#47;a> Project wrote a series of articles on the  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sonatype.com&#47;people&#47;author&#47;jason&#47;">blog<&#47;a> at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sonatype.com">Sonartype<&#47;a>, which are describing the future road map of Maven 3.0.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-51"></a>It was quite funny: On the friday after I wrote my article I had a discussion on the lunch break with a <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.xing.com&#47;profile&#47;Bjorn_Stachmann">colleague<&#47;a> just about this topic. On sunday evening I stumbled accidentally across the first article from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;jvanzyl">Jason van Zyl<&#47;a> with the title <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sonatype.com&#47;people&#47;2009&#47;11&#47;maven-3x-paving-the-desire-lines-part-one-2&#47;">"Maven 3.x: Paving the desire lines &mdash; Part One"<&#47;a>. In this article Jason describes how the Maven development team tried to figure which way to go with Maven 3.0. Besides the fascinating informations the article is also fun to read, very nice. A few days later the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sonatype.com&#47;people&#47;2009&#47;11&#47;maven-3x-paving-the-desire-lines-part-two&#47;">second part<&#47;a> was published. Which was great, too.</p>
<p>After reading these articles I was some kind of reconciled and excited about the future of Maven. But I had also a lot of work to do to prepare the new Release of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.scoyo.de">scoyo<&#47;a>. So the only thing I could to was to add the Sonartype blog to my RSS reader.</p>
<p>So it happens that I didn't miss the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sonatype.com&#47;people&#47;2009&#47;11&#47;maven-30-alpha-3-released&#47;">announcement of the first public alpha version<&#47;a> of Maven 3.0. I had not enough time so far to check it out, but I will follow the events eagerly.</p>
<p>So sometimes things happen parallel and my complaints about building and Maven came along with the start of the 3.0 series of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;maven.apache.org">Apache Maven<&#47;a> project.</p>
