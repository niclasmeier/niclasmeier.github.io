This afternoon I spend some time to take the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jaev.googlecode.com">jaev<&#47;a> Framework closer to the 1.0 final release.</p>
<p>The second release candidate was built this afternoon. It contains some fixes and some improvements suggested by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pmd.sourceforge.net&#47;">PMD<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;findbugs.sourceforge.net">Findbugs<&#47;a>. Another major focus was to improve the performance of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jaev.googlecode.com">jaev<&#47;a>. This was achieved in reducing the number DNS lookups by introducing a cache for DNS MX record resolution.</p>
<p>This may lead to another nifty feature in the next release candidate, final or 1.1 release. I am planning to introduce a domain suggest function. This may be achieved by using a fix&#47;initial suggestion list and the queries against the DNS lookup cache. If everything works out well the i.e. the Tapestry 5 example may offer a suggest function for e-mail addresses.</p>
