<p>Thanks to a former colleague, I received word that my post about my first <a href="/2012/04/first-hundred-days-of-clojure/">100 days of working with Clojure</a> scored Number 3. on the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank all of you for the interest and I really hope my english is not that worse. Thanks to some attentive readers, I where able to fix some glitches in some of the examples or the spelling.</p>
<p>Due to fortunate circumstances I had some time to setup <a href="/2011/04/nginxing-around-with-wordpress-2/">my blog on a new platform</a> almost exactly a year ago. Now using <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org">Nginx</a> with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. Witch performed remarkably well.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-152"></a>If your are interested here are some stats:</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.niclas-meier.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/localhost-nginx_status-day.png" alt="Localhost nginx status day" width="486" height="305" border="0" /></p>
<p>Starting with about 200 concurrent connections to the my Nging web server, which are 66 times the average over the last year. That's nice because I saw some setups which would have died due to the load. Thanks to <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Lukas_Loesche2">the guy who introduced me into Nginx</a>. We were using it at <a href="www.scoyo.com">scoyo</a> and <a href="http://www.gamigo.com">gamigo</a> and this proved that it was a good decision - if I had any doubts left.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, that worked so well, that it didn't even had an impact on the CPU load:
<img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.niclas-meier.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/localhost-load-day.png" alt="Localhost load day" width="486" height="257" border="0" />
<img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.niclas-meier.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/localhost-load-month1.png" alt="Localhost load month" width="486" height="257" border="0" /></p>
<p>Or even the memory usage:</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.niclas-meier.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/localhost-memory-day.png" alt="Localhost memory day" width="486" height="401" border="0" /></p>
<p>I guess making all the content static using <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP SuperCache</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpRewriteModule">HTTP rewrite module</a> was a good idea.</p>
