<p>Thanks to a former colleague, I received word that my post about my first <a href="&#47;2012&#47;04&#47;first-hundred-days-of-clojure&#47;">100 days of working with Clojure<&#47;a> scored Number 3. on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.ycombinator.com&#47;">Hacker News<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank all of you for the interest and I really hope my english is not that worse. Thanks to some attentive readers, I where able to fix some glitches in some of the examples or the spelling.</p>
<p>Due to fortunate circumstances I had some time to setup <a href="&#47;2011&#47;04&#47;nginxing-around-with-wordpress-2&#47;">my blog on a new platform<&#47;a> almost exactly a year ago. Now using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.nginx.org">Nginx<&#47;a> with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wordpress.org&#47;">Wordpress<&#47;a>. Witch performed remarkably well.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-152"></a>If your are interested here are some stats:</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.niclas-meier.de&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;04&#47;localhost-nginx_status-day.png" alt="Localhost nginx status day" width="486" height="305" border="0" &#47;></p>
<p>Starting with about 200 concurrent connections to the my Nging web server, which are 66 times the average over the last year. That's nice because I saw some setups which would have died due to the load. Thanks to <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.xing.com&#47;profile&#47;Lukas_Loesche2">the guy who introduced me into Nginx<&#47;a>. We were using it at <a href="www.scoyo.com">scoyo<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gamigo.com">gamigo<&#47;a> and this proved that it was a good decision - if I had any doubts left.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, that worked so well, that it didn't even had an impact on the CPU load:<br />
<img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.niclas-meier.de&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;04&#47;localhost-load-day.png" alt="Localhost load day" width="486" height="257" border="0" &#47;><br />
<img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.niclas-meier.de&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;04&#47;localhost-load-month1.png" alt="Localhost load month" width="486" height="257" border="0" &#47;></p>
<p>Or even the memory usage:</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.niclas-meier.de&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;04&#47;localhost-memory-day.png" alt="Localhost memory day" width="486" height="401" border="0" &#47;></p>
<p>I guess making all the content static using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wordpress.org&#47;extend&#47;plugins&#47;wp-super-cache&#47;">WP SuperCache<&#47;a> and the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.nginx.org&#47;HttpRewriteModule">HTTP rewrite module<&#47;a> was a good idea.</p>
