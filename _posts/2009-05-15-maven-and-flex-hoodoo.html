  The last time <a href="&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;mavenizing-a-flex-build&#47;">when I blogged about the Flex mojos<&#47;a> I was still quite frustrated and thought I had a better solution. Now some time passed and on April the 3rd the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;flex-mojos.info&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;03&#47;ann-flexmojos-31-released&#47;">new version (3.1) of the flex mojos was released<&#47;a> and me and some of my colleges made some interesting discoveries.<&#47;p>

Well, but in the last few weeks I often thought about the meaning and the source of the word mojo. Lets take a closer look at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Mojo_(African_American_culture)">wikipedia.<&#47;a></p>
<blockquote cite="http:&#47;&#47;de.selfhtml.org&#47;">
<p>
Mojo (pronounced &#47;ˈmoʊdʒoʊ&#47;) is a term commonly encountered in the African-American folk belief called hoodoo. A mojo is a type of magic charm, often of red flannel cloth and tied with a drawstring, containing botanical, zoological, and&#47;or mineral curios, petition papers, and the like. It is typically worn under clothing.<&#47;p><&#47;blockquote><br />
Okay, hoodoo! That explains quite a lot. Sometimes maven and the flex-mojos are a kind of magic.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
But let's get back on topic ;-) The boys from the Flex mojos where quite busy and created with the 3.x release very usable platform for flex builds in the maven world. It took us (mainly a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.peter-jacobsen.de&#47;">freelance colleague<&#47;a>) two more weeks to adapt our build process form various ant scripts into a multi-module maven2 build. But now it looks quite nice, the build is even faster and we were able to fix a problem with our Flex Builder configuration.<br />
