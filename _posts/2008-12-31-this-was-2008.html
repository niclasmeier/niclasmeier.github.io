<p>With 2008 almost over, I am just want to take the chance to write a short "Goodbye" for this year. It was quite exiting! I fell in love again, which took quite some years. How it's gonna work out, we will see in 2009 ...<br />

With 2008 almost over, I am just want to take the chance to write a short "Goodbye" for this year. It was quite exiting! I fell in love again, which took quite some years. How it's gonna work out, we will see in 2009. At this moment my girl friends visits her parents. She stayed there before christmas and won't be back in Hamburg this year. Some pretty lonely holidays ;-) I am misusing the time to play way to much <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wow-europe.de">World of Warcraft<&#47;a> and preparing some skills I will need for my new job, which will start in Feburary 2009.</p>
<p>After nine years and four month at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.SinnerSchrader.de">SinnerSchrader<&#47;a> I am pretty nervous how this will be. It was my first employment after I graduated at the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.fh-wedel.de">Fachhochschule Wedel<&#47;a>. Hell I will really miss some of the boys and girls! But I am still convinced that this is the time for me to move on.</p>
<p>One of these "new skills" I am preparing is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.adobe.com&#47;de&#47;products&#47;flex&#47;">Adobe Flex<&#47;a>, which is a framework to create rich clients for the internet based on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.adobe.com&#47;de&#47;products&#47;flashplayer&#47;">Adobe Flashplayer<&#47;a>.<br />
Quite an intresting and well designed piece of Software. This is still my first impression ;-) I'm pretty sure I will discover some very ugly facets later. I already ran about some bugs with the HTTPService which prevented my from setting the "User-Agent" header on a HTTP GET request. Damn I am demanding I know :-)<br />
But the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;eu.wowarmory.com&#47;">WoW Armory<&#47;a> refused to return pure XML until I pretend to be the Firefox 2.x Browser. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;eu.wowarmory.com&#47;">WoW Armory<&#47;a>  is also a pretty interesting piece of software. It offers the facilities to query WoW Characters, Guilds or Items via the Web. If you are using a Firefox browser the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;eu.wowarmory.com&#47;">WoW Armory<&#47;a> returns only a XML which will be rendered with a XSLT style sheet. All the other Browser will get an "interesting" HTML page. Maybe I am blogging about this later.</p>
<p>One last thing left to do for 2009:</p>
<p>Wie man so sch&ouml;n in Deutschland sagt: Einen Guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr!</p>
