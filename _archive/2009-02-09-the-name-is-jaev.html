  The name of who/what is jaev? The jaev framework is my first open source project! Jepp, I joined the community and giving something back after years of using the frameworks of other people.

  What does jaev do? The name jaev is the abbreviation for <i>ja</i>va (<i>a</i>dvanced) <i>e</i>mail <i>v</i>alidation. So the framework does validate e-mails. Sounds quite boring, isn't it? Of course not!

The name of who/what is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev</a>? The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev framework</a> is my first open source project! Jepp, I joined the community and giving something back after years of using the frameworks of other people.</p>
<p>What does jaev do? The name <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev</a> is the abbreviation for <i>ja</i>va (<i>a</i>dvanced) <i>e</i>mail <i>v</i>alidation. So the framework does validate e-mails. Sounds quite boring, isn't it? Of course not! There are some quite good tools for e-mail validation like the one in the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/validator/">Apache commons validator</a> project (I <i>"borrowed"</i> some test cases there). But the e-mail validation in java was quite shallow. If you want to have a more advanced validation, i.e. of the domain, you'll had to do it yourself. The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev framework</a> tries to fill this gap.</p>
<p>It provides facilities to validate the syntax of an e-mail address with including addresses with names like <code>Niclas Meier <niclas.meier@example.com></code>  (I confess the handling of comments in e-mail addresses has still some flaws, but it's not so important I guess). This is obligatory but the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev framework</a> offers quite more.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev framework</a> you'll may check the domain of the e-mail address. The framework uses a local (or server) copy of the IANA top level domain database (<a href="http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt</a>) to validate the top level domain. If the top level domain is okay  the DNS database will be queries if the domain exists and has <code>MX</code> entries. If a domain has no <code>MX</code> entries you'll have to assume that you will could not relay an e-mail message to the e-mail address. The mail server uses the same mechanism.</p>
<p>A very important feature of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev framework</a> is: You have the choice! You are receiving a <code>Result</code> object as outcome of the validation process. The <code>Result</code> contains a code, which specifies the details, and a validity level which specifies  the level of validity of an e-mail address. I.e. <code>SYNTAX</code> suggests that an e-mail address is syntactically valid but the domain and account may be invalid. The maximum validity is <code>ACCESSIBLE</code>. With <code>ACCESSIBLE</code> validity the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev framework</a> was able to verify the existence and accessibility of the e-mail address on the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_Transfer_Agent">MTA</a> of the e-mail domain.</p>
<p>This is the last big feature of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev framework</a>. The framework can connect to the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_Transfer_Agent">MTA</a> specified in the MX entry of the domain and tries to send an e-mail to the e-mail address. If the mail transfer can be initiated the framework will abort the process, no mail will be send, but we can assure that the e-mail account exits.</p>
<p>Around the three step validation mechanism the framework offers quite simple and extendible construction and configuration mechanisms, examples for JSF, Tapestry 5 and Flex &amp; BlazeD and different acceptance strategies. Timeouts may be applied on different levels and operations, so you can assure that you'll get a <code>Result</code> in a defined amount of time.</p>
<p>I think this is quite a handy package. And I spent lots of my spare time the last four weeks to bring this to life. Maybe someone out there agrees with me and uses the framework in his application.</p>
<p>If you encounter some problems or you would like to contribute/request some features you may post them to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jaev-users?pli=1">google group</a> or to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/issues/list">issue management system</a>. Maybe there is someone out there who is firm in <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> which the jeav framework uses for e-mail parsing.</p>
