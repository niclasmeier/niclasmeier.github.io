Well, but in the last few weeks I often thought about the meaning and the source of the word mojo. Lets take a closer look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_(African_American_culture)">wikipedia.</a></p>
<blockquote cite="http://de.selfhtml.org/">
<p>
Mojo (pronounced /ˈmoʊdʒoʊ/) is a term commonly encountered in the African-American folk belief called hoodoo. A mojo is a type of magic charm, often of red flannel cloth and tied with a drawstring, containing botanical, zoological, and/or mineral curios, petition papers, and the like. It is typically worn under clothing.</p></blockquote>
Okay, hoodoo! That explains quite a lot. Sometimes maven and the flex-mojos are a kind of magic.

But let's get back on topic ;-) The boys from the Flex mojos where quite busy and created with the 3.x release very usable platform for flex builds in the maven world. It took us (mainly a <a href="http://www.peter-jacobsen.de/">freelance colleague</a>) two more weeks to adapt our build process form various ant scripts into a multi-module maven2 build. But now it looks quite nice, the build is even faster and we were able to fix a problem with our Flex Builder configuration.
