<p>My new <a href="http://www.scoyo.de">employer</a> has created his first TV spot. It addresses the target audience quite aggressively, but I guess it's all right. The german culture lacks the will to pay for education at all.</p></p>
<p>Due to my position as head of client development I am very curios about the performance of our website when TV broadcasting starts. We have lots of good people in the operations and software development team but we never tested our system in peak usage scenarios. I'll guess you can't simulate the load generated by TV broadcast anyway. This reminds me on the 30th of may 2005, when we launched the <a href="http://www.simyo.de">simyo Website</a> with prime time TV spots. Damn, I was nervous. And I really was relieved when called your customer to tell that the website was fine (gimme more!) and they already sold over 1,000 units. A highlight on their release party, which I missed. But I was a scary chicken that day and didn't want to travel half around Germany while nobody takes care about a brand new website ;-)

<p>So, this is the scoyo TV spot:</p>

<p>I'll keep my fingers crossed when the first TV spot goes over the air ...</p></p>
