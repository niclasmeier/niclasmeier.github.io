<p>It has been some time since my last blog post. But I promise to do better. I am planning a series ob blog post in which I am trying to explain how you should want to develop software nowadays - at least in my opinon.</p>
<p>I will try to cover topics like: How to build your system? How to manage you source code and you versions? Or what do do with your deployment data?</p>
<p>But I don't want you to tell you which frameworks to use in fact I want to discuss what you should want to do not how you are going to do it.</p>
<p>I am excited, it will be a lot of work, but I am excited ;-)</p>
