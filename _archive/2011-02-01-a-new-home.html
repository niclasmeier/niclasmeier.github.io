<p>I just wanted to say, that I am back - at least a kind of ;-) </p>
<p>The last couple of month I was buried under a sh****** of work since I joined my new <a href="http://www.gamigo.com">employer</a>, but on the other hand side I a lot of fun and it is a <i>very</i> challenging job.</p>
<p>The last couple of weeks I used some spare time to move my infrastructure to a new home, including this blog. I will shut down my private blog soon, I guess my live is not exciting enough or may be I am not exhibitionistic enough to write over every breath I take. But now this blog is almost completely migrated and got a shiny new theme too - I hope you like it!</p>
<p>The good news are, that I want to take up my technophile blogging activities. I learned very much in the last couple of month about writing good software and what to do to prevent it.</p>
