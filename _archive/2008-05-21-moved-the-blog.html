<p>Nothing is more constant lik change. I decided to move my blog to a different provider and a different blog system. So welcome my new old blog with almost no entries here at <a href="http://nicl.net" target="_blank>nicl.net</a> ...</p>
<p>You may wonder what a nicl is? "Nicl" has been my nickname for several years and originates from my school days which are now more than 15 years away. Creepy!</p>
<p>So, I discovered that my provider has offered my the possibility to create a blog on an existing account, so i decided to consolidate my resources while the work is still small, so here we are.</p>
<p>The weather is fine and I was lazy in the last week - too many web 2.0 stuff :-), so I am now taking a run around my hometown <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Finkenwerder" target="_blank">Finkenwerder</a> which is a district of the nice city of <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Hamburg" target="_blank">Hamburg</a>.</p>
