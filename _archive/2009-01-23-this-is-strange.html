Wednesday was my last day working day at my <a href="http.//www.sinnerschrader.de">old job</a>. It was quite a strange feeling when I left the building. On my way out I made a small round just to say a quick goodbye to some very nice colleagues. Unfortunately I missed a couple of very close ones, but I decided against staying any longer, but that's okay because three to four other colleagues, leaving in the next few weeks, and me decided to make a small party next week. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will work out as expected.</p>
<p>After nine years and five month it wouldn't be nice of me to leave without a notice and <a href="http.//www.sinnerschrader.de">there</a> a quite a lot a very nice people. But in a couple of days I have to consider me as <a href="https://www.xing.com/net/sinnerschrader/">alumni</a>. But this has benefits too. On <a href="http://www.sysadminday.com/">System Administrator Appreciation Day</a> there will be plenty of topics to talk about.</p>
<p>So what to do in the next couple of days? Now I am sitting here at home on my computer and blogging. But this won't last until the 2 February when I am starting my new job at <a href="http://www.scoyo.de">scoyo</a>. I am pretty exited and not even in a mood for a vacation. On top of it, the January in my old job was strange because nobody had real work for me to do. Okay that's not quite correct, but if you are used to have a very full inbox and a very noisy telephone, it is quite strange if the telephone doesn't ring anymore.</p>
<p>So I decided to push things a little bit at <a href="http://jaev.googlecode.com/">a small project</a> which I started a couple of month ago. It's making quite some progress at this moment, and I am pretty confident that I have some stuff for more blog entries.</p>
<p>Parallel I am working on my <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/">Actionscript</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/">Flex</a> skills. It's quite nice but I am desperately looking for an example or application which really challenges me. It's quite a little bit academic at the moment.</p>
