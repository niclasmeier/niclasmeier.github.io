  Last weekend I took three days off, bought my copy of <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/de/info/features/wrath.xml">World of Warcraft - Wrath of the Lich King</a> and locked up the door. After a very long Weekend my Character <a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Eredar&n=Whitewolf">Whitewolf</a> is now level 78 (50% to level 79).

<p>Last weekend I took three days off, bought my copy of <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/de/info/features/wrath.xml">World of Warcraft - Wrath of the Lich King</a> and locked up the door.

<p>This is pretty much at the maximum I expected. Level 75 would have been a satisfactory achievement but 78(.5) is quite outstanding. Especially if you take into account, that I restarted playing World of Warcraft just 10 to 12 weeks ago.</p>
<p>My special congratulations to out fast leveling guys which made couple of realm <a href="http://www.loh-gilde.de/Portal/Neuigkeiten/Gilde/2008/Level-80-Realm-First!">first Level 80 achievements</a> (Gnome, Night Elf, Human, Draenei, Warlock and Hunter) -  So grats to <a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Eredar&n=Cel&iacute;ne">DasOpossum</a>, <a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Eredar&n=Crematory">Pepi</a>, <a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Eredar&n=Hamzu">Hamzu</a> and <a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Eredar&n=Arthuria">Hikaru</a>. But great thanks and respect to all of my guild mates which are doing a great job leveling their characters and preparing to raid again. As far as I know the first 10 person raid instances have already been cleared.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Eredar&n=Dashina">Dashina</a> for leveling most of the time with me :-)</p>
<p>Greetings to all the Blizzard folks, you made an awesome new expansion! Keep improving the quest mechanics. There are very cool quests now. But also improve the moral standards of your quests. Torturing prisoners or stealing babies of some poor creatures is not a role model for young people in my opinion.</p>
<p>I am leaving now for work and trying to get level 80 this week, wish me luck :-)</p>
