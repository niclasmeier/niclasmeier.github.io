<p>After some weeks the third release candidate of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev</a> was the final one yesterday.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/">jaev</a> framework is in productional use at least one installation and no major problems where filed so far. I'm keeping my fingers crossed ;-)</p>
<p>I am working already on some new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caching negative responses of mail serversWhen a mail server refuses communication due to suspected spam, the result will be cached to reduce network traffic.</li>
<li>Suggest e-mail addressesWhen the validation fails suggest a list e-mail addresses. This algorithm may use the previous request and a default list of domains to compute some suggestions.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>If you have any good ideas, file them on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaev/issues/list">issue tracking system</a> or the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jaev-users/topics">google group</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I am applying for a <a href="http://wave.google.com">google wave</a> developer sandbox access to provide a <a href="http://wave.google.com">google wave</a> robot for online e-mail suggestion. Bah, that sounds like some work ;-)</p>
