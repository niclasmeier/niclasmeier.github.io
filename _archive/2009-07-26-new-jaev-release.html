<p>Today I made a new release of the <a href="http://jaev.googlecode.com">jaev Framework</a> for "advanced" e-mail validation. After being in productive use for quite some month now it was about time to offer a bugfix release. Some issues with domains containing no MX but an A DNS record where resolved. E-mail belonging to this kind of domains will now be accepted. An issue with a file handle leak due to unclosed UDP connections during the DNS lookup was also fixed.</p>
<p>Due to the generosity of Google I got a nice <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google wave</a> test account. Now I am looking desperately to some spare time to evaluate the integration of <a href="http://jaev.googlecode.com">jaev</a> to the <a href="http://wave.google.com/">wave</a>. One idea is to expand the validation to wave addresses via the <a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/">wave protocol</a>. Maybe an online validation as wave bot is another exciting idea.</p>
